# Server Code of Conduct

> **Legal note:** This document provides practical guidance. The **binding** restrictions on monetization and intolerance for server operators are in **CEPL §5(b)**. Listing/delisting rules here are in addition to CEPL.

To be listed officially or to use the Project's name/branding, servers must agree to:

1. **No monetization** — no paid access, perks, lootboxes, ads, or real-world trading.
2. **No intolerance** — no racism, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny/misandry, or other forms of hate.
3. **No harmful or illegal content** — no pornography, CSAM, or otherwise prohibited material.
4. **Anti-griefing measures** — servers must provide basic protections such as bans, mutes, or rollbacks.
5. **Respect privacy** — servers may use encrypted client identifiers (IP, hostname hashes) to prevent ban evasion but may not store or share personal information.

Servers violating these rules will be delisted and lose access to official branding.

## Player Content (UGC)

Players retain ownership of skins, builds, and other user-generated content they upload. By uploading to a server, players grant the server operator and the Project a non-exclusive, worldwide license to host, display, and distribute such content in connection with gameplay and community features. Servers must remove specific UGC upon the rightful owner’s request if it violates law or this policy.
