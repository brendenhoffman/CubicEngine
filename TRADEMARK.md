# Trademark & Branding Policy

The **CubicEngine** name and official **logos** (the “Marks”) are trademarks of the Project. No trademark rights are granted under the CubicEngine Public License (CEPL). Use of the Marks is governed by this policy.

## Prohibited Uses (without written permission)

- Using the Marks on forks or servers that monetize gameplay.
- Using the Marks on forks or servers that promote intolerance.
- Using the Marks on forks or servers that host harmful or illegal content.
- Any use implying official endorsement, partnership, or sponsorship.

> **Note on Assets:** In addition to these trademark rules, the Project’s artwork and music are licensed under [Asset License & Contributor Agreement](ASSETS_LICENSE.md). Use of such Assets is prohibited in forks or servers that violate CEPL §1 (Monetization) or §2 (Inclusivity), unless the contributor who created the Asset has separately licensed it or withdrawn it from the Project.

## Violations / Remedies

- Violation of this policy (e.g., operating a monetized or intolerant server) revokes your right to use both the Project’s Marks and any Project-distributed Assets, unless the original Asset creator has separately licensed them to you.
- Violations of this policy or CEPL §1–§2 may result in (i) delisting, (ii) revocation of rights to use the Marks, and (iii) where the violation involves misuse of Project-distributed Assets, the Project **may** prospectively remove or replace those Assets from future official builds to prevent further misuse. This does not affect any separate license an artist may have granted outside the Project.

## Permitted Uses (no permission needed)

- Nominative/factual use (e.g., “A mod for CubicEngine”).
- Non-commercial mods and servers that comply with the [Server Code of Conduct](SERVERS.md), using community badges or text references (not logos).
- Fan works (art, videos, reviews) that are non-commercial and respectful.

We may revoke permission at any time if your use misleads users or violates this policy.
