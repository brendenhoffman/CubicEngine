## Principles

- The Project will always remain **free and open source**.
- The deviation from standard OSI licenses is solely to protect contributors and enforce rules against intolerance and monetization.
- Our commitment is to a welcoming and enjoyable ecosystem for all.

## Core Rules

- No intolerance (racism, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny/misandry, etc).
- No monetization (gambling, real-world trading, microtransactions, ads, etc).
- No harmful or illegal content (pornography, CSAM, etc).

## Legal & Privacy

- We will **never comply with age verification laws**. Access may be limited or unavailable in some regions; availability is not guaranteed.
- We will **never store or share personal information**.
  - Servers may use encrypted identifiers for ban circumvention prevention.
  - Third-party login methods (e.g., Steam) are governed by their own terms.

## Enforcement FAQ

- **Reporting violations**: Send reports to [cubicengine@emailengine.net].
- **Actions we may take**: takedown requests, delisting servers, revoking branding rights, public notice.
  In extreme cases, we may pursue legal enforcement to protect contributors’ rights and enforce CEPL restrictions.
- **Asset misuse remedy:** For unauthorized or policy-violating uses of Project-distributed Assets, we may request takedown from the violator and **prospectively** remove/replace the affected Asset(s) from future official builds. We do not alter users’ existing local files.
- **Grace periods**: We generally allow a 30-day cure period for violations, except in cases of harmful or illegal content.
- **Appeals**: Contact [cubicengine@emailengine.net] with justification; we reserve the right to make final decisions.
