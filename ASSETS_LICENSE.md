# Asset License & Contributor Agreement

Unless otherwise noted, assets contributed to the Project are licensed under
[CC-BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), with the following additional conditions:

These terms are **binding via CEPL §3**. In case of conflict, CEPL controls.

1. Artists and musicians **retain full ownership** of their work.
2. By contributing, they grant the Project a non-exclusive license to include their work in official releases.
3. Assets may not be reused in forks or servers that:
   - Monetize gameplay (gambling, real-world trading, microtransactions, ads, etc).
   - Promote intolerance (racism, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny/misandry, etc).
   - Host harmful or illegal content (pornography, CSAM, etc).
4. Contributors may **withdraw their work** at any time. Withdrawn works will be removed from future releases, though past versions will remain valid.
   - Withdrawal is prospective only. Assets already included in prior versions cannot be retroactively removed from users’ local copies.
   - Withdrawal requests must be made in writing (email or signed commit). We will act in good faith to remove the Asset from future releases within 30 days.
     The Project does not and will not distribute tools that alter or delete user-installed files.
5. Both the contributor and the Project have the right to enforce these terms against unauthorized use.
6. Contributors remain free to license or sell their work outside the Project under any terms they choose.
   The non-commercial restriction applies only to the copy contributed to and distributed with the Project.

## Use-Restriction Breach by Third Parties

If Project-distributed Assets are used in a product, server, or fork that violates CEPL §1 (Monetization) and/or §2 (Inclusivity), or otherwise breaches the Asset License, the Project may take remedial action to protect contributors and the community, including:

- **Delisting and branding revocation** for the violating product/server/fork;
- **Takedown requests** directed at the violator for unauthorized Asset use; and
- **Prospective removal or replacement of the affected Asset(s) from future Project builds** at the maintainers’ discretion.

**Process.** Upon credible notice of a breach, the Project will make a good-faith review and may provide the violator up to 30 days to cure, except in cases involving harmful/illegal content where action may be immediate. Any Project removal or replacement is **prospective only** and will not affect users’ existing local copies. The Project will not distribute tools that alter or delete user-installed files.

**No penalty to the artist.** Project action against a violator does not limit the contributor’s independent rights. Contributors remain free to continue licensing their Asset(s) elsewhere (including commercially) under their own terms.

**Separate licenses.** If a contributor has separately licensed an Asset to a violator on terms that permit the disputed use, the Project’s internal removal/replacement decision will not affect that separate license between the contributor and the violator.

## Attribution

Contributors will be credited for their work in the following ways:

- In-game credits screen (artist name or chosen pseudonym).
- Asset manifest file in the repository (listing contributor, license, SPDX tag).

Contributors may specify:

- Their preferred display name or pseudonym.
- An optional link (e.g., portfolio, website, Mastodon handle).

We will make reasonable efforts to preserve attribution across forks and distributions.
